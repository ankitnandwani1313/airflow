# Airflow Deployment on EC2 using Docker

This repository is designed to set up and deploy Apache Airflow on an EC2 instance using Docker. The repository includes necessary folder structures and configuration files to initialize and run the Airflow application within a Docker container.

## Folder Structure

The following folders are created as per Airflow's requirements:

- **/dags**: This directory will contain all the custom DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) that are created for running workflows and data pipelines.
- **/plugins**: This directory is intended for any custom plugins, such as operators, sensors, or hooks, that extend Airflow's functionality.
- **/logs**: This directory is used by Airflow to store logs generated during the execution of tasks.

## Docker Setup

This repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file, which is essential for:

- Initializing the Airflow application.
- Binding the Docker container to the EC2 instance.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services required to run Airflow, such as the webserver, scheduler, and any additional components.

## Custom DAGs

Custom DAGs will be created and added to the `/dags` folder. These DAGs will be scheduled to run on the EC2 instance and deliver transformed data to various data sources.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your EC2 instance and ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. You can then run the Airflow application using the `docker-compose.yml` file provided.
